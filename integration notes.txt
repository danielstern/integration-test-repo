travis integration notes:
- make .travis.yml (note: TWO dots)
- sign in to travis via Github (nice)
- travis (regular), "magnum travis" (private)https://travis-ci.org/getting_started
  - travis works by default with github (you just need to sign in)
- get your token from the top-left corner (how to show this in video without sharing token?)
- once you add Travis, it will auto-integrate into Github
