travis integration notes:
- make .travis.yml (note: TWO dots)`
- sign in to travis via Github (nice)
- travis (regular), "magnum travis" (private)https://travis-ci.org/getting_started
  - travis works by default with github (you just need to sign in)
- get your token from the top-left corner (how to show this in video without sharing token?)
- once you add Travis, it will auto-integrate into Github
  - default is Ruby
  - set environment variables in travis .yml
- make a change and push the repo, then go to travis home page. You will see build running.
- upload a different branch - it will show up in branches
- create a pull request, notice another Travis build starts. go to PR and Travis warning will appear in real time.
  - click link on PR to go to travis page
- note, errors may appear if Node version isn't configured properly
- configure node version in travis.yml, add version 5, 4, and 0.10
- notice how some builds pass, and some fail - useful!
